During my second year of undergraduate studies at IIT Bombay, I worked on an R&D project with Professor Ambarish Kunwar. The project primarily involved the acquisition of EMG signals and their digital signal processing using IIR filters.

I would also recommend going through my project report for a better overview. The next goal of this project would be to apply Machine Learning, mainly in the domain of pattern recognition.
